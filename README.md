# Archipelago Terraria Client

Not to be confused with prior implementations:

* [TerrariaFlagRandomizer](https://github.com/Cronus-waters/TerrariaFlagRandomizer)
* [TerrariaAchipelago](https://github.com/Whoneedspacee/TerrariaArchipelago)

This implementations uses boss kills and event clears as checks. The items are the permanent
changes to the world that bosses reward in vanilla. Things like "Witch Doctor can now spawn",
"The Dungeon is in Post-Plantera mode", and various things caused by Hardmode. Bosses still drop
their original loot, though.

See [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) if you don't know what it is.

## Future Work

- [X] Remove effects from original bosses
- [X] Re-add effects conditionally
- [ ] Server-side implementation
- [ ] Announce boss / event clears to server
- [ ] Client responses to server
- [ ] Archipelago features
