# Archipelago Terraria Client

Not to be confused with prior implementations:

* [TerrariaFlagRandomizer](https://github.com/Cronus-waters/TerrariaFlagRandomizer)
* [TerrariaAchipelago](https://github.com/Whoneedspacee/TerrariaArchipelago)

This implementations uses boss kills and event clears as checks. The items are the permanent
changes to the world that bosses reward in vanilla. Things like "Dryad can now spawn", "The dungeon
is in Post-Plantera mode", and various things caused by Hardmode. Bosses still drop their original
loot, though.

See [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) if you don't know what it is.
